                        known. Only you could be so bold. The Imperial Senate
                        will not sit for this, when they hear you've attacked a
                        diplomatic. Don't play games with me, Your Highness. You
                        weren't on any mercy mission this time. They're more
                        dangerous than you realize. Dangerous to your starfleet,
                        Commander, not to this battle station! The Rebellion
                        will continue to gain a support in the Imperial Senate
                        as long as.. The Imperial Senate will no longer be of
                        any concern to us. I've just received word that the
                        Emperor has dissolved the council permanently.
